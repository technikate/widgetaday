Hello! 
This is the GitHub repo for my A Widget a Day project. 
I chose to embark on this challenge with the knowledge that for me, in coding, learning comes from doing. Since I don't have consistent grand app ideas, and since I know I need to broaden my skill set, I decided to build one small UI component a day. (Or a day-ish: I anticipate that some components will take longer than a day, I try to keep my Saturdays tech-free, and, of course, I foresee life happening from time to time.)
My focus will be on usability and accessibility, since that's where my passion lies. I plan to mainly use JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap for creating; ARIA and WCAG standards for accessibility; and occasionally Python and R for data visualization.
So welcome, and feel free to check out my code! Hopefully you'll notice an upward trend in my skills as the days pass. If not, I hope you'll at least note some amount of consistency and tenacity.
